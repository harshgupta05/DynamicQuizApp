## React Quiz App's Features

The wonderful features of the quiz app.

- The user can pick a quiz topic on the first screen, like JavaScript, React etc.

- There will be a timer running when the quiz starts. If the timer finishes, the quiz will be stopped, and the user will be asked to see the result.

- Each question has a score. For example, a difficult question has 10 marks, and an easier one has 5.

- The result screen shows how many questions the user attempted, how much he scored, how long it took, and whether he passed or failed.

- In result screen user can see which question had the right answer and which was wrong. The user can find the correct answer in case of a wrong answer.
